# TamperMonkey Script

## Prompt for chatgpt-url-query.js

```
You task is to make the script #file:chatgpt-url-query.js  fill in the textarea and press the button, or click the send button faster, I need to provide more details.

In chronological order, when the webpage loads the textarea and button for the first time, the entire element appears as shown in field-before-loaded.html. At this stage, the button is a disabled Send button. After a while, the Send button becomes a "Use voice mode" button, as shown in field-after-load.html. However, you do not need to worry about the button during this 2 phases. You only need to find the input area and fill in the content I want you to enter ASAP.

After filling in the content, the button should change (the change may not be immediate, maybe after a while), since it now allows sending the message. You will see the button become an enabled send button, as shown in field-with-input.html. When the button becomes enabled, it is time to send the query message. You can now press Enter or click the Send button, with pressing Enter being preferred. When a response is being generated, the button changes again, as shown in field-when-generating.html.
